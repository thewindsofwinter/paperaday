# A Paper A Day [New Year's Initiative 1C]

A Paper A Day is an initiative that I will be maintaining throughout 2021, as one of my New Year's resolutions. Each day, I will be reading a paper in a specified field of science, with a potential for significant impacts on our way of life or particular interest to my own mind, to expand my understanding of broad areas of science. This repository will house any and all software developed in pursuit of this goal, for any who wish to follow in my journey. (List: http://bit.ly/journal-daily)

## What's (going to be) in this repository?

 * Website with a list of papers and personal notes [TBD, soon] 
 * Software to query topical high-impact journals for article candidates [TBD, later]
